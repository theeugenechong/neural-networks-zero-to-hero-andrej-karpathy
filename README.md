## Overview

Here are the notebooks I've created in watching this insightful video series on language modeling by Andrej Karpathy on YouTube. Andrej Karpathy is a renowned computer scientist and the researcher at OpenAI (former Director of AI at Tesla). 

In this series, he delves deep into the basics of neural networks, the simple mathematics behind them, backpropagation from scratch, language modeling, covering various topics, techniques, and applications.
